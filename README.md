# Strict Objects for PHP ðŸŒ»

![PHP tests](https://github.com/smuuf/php-strict-object/workflows/PHP%20tests/badge.svg)

Avoid annoying problems caused by PHP being too lax when dealing with undeclared object properties. Let's be more strict. Don't let typos in property names ruin your day ever again. ðŸŒž

## Installation
```bash
composer require smuuf/strict-object
```

## Usage

Simple, just `use` the `\Smuuf\StrictObject` trait in your class to make it strict - and to **throw `\LogicException`** when someone tries to **read** or to **write** to an **undeclared property**.

```php
<?php

use \Smuuf\StrictObject;

require __DIR__ . '/../bootstrap.php';

class Whatever {

	use StrictObject;

	public $someProperty;

}

$obj = new Whatever;

$obj->someProperty = 1; // Ok.
echo $obj->someProperty; // Ok.

// But - and hold on to your hats...

$obj->bogusProperty = 1; // Throws \LogicException.
echo $obj->bogusProperty; // Throws \LogicException.

```
